# Patterns

These are fabric patterns.

## analyze_release_integrity

This pattern is to be run against the output of a git commit log. Yup.

## npm_release_detector

This pattern will attempt to identify software tagged for release but missing a commit log or any fanfare you'd ordinarily see?

## supply_chain_forensics

a multi-match approach. greedy and possibly a runaway train, be careful.
